# AIPS-Proper-Motion-Correction
The purpose of this script is to automate the proper motion correction of VLBI images using AIPS. It follows the process of taking a calibrated data set, splitting it into an appropriate number of time-bins according to a given proper motion, shifting the phase centre of each time-bin to so that a moving peak is remains in the same position relative to the phase centre of the first time-bin, and then concatenate the time-bins into a single data set. The resultant image will follow a source as it moves.
